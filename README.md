# Employee
This week assignment has following three tasks:

1. Save the Employee data from api.js to localStorage so that it is not destroyed when the browser is closed. Following should be the workflow:
a) When the application is started, localStorage is checked, if it has Employee data, it should be loaded into the Employee's array.
b) Whenever any modification(addition, deletion, updation) is made, array is synced with the local storage.

2. Learn JQuery and replace all the DOM manipulation JS code in app.js by JQuery.

3. Install NodeJs and use https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server to create Employee API and replace your api.js with it.
